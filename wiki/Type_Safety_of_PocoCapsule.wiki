== Type Safety in C++ ==

Type safety in C++ means language type systems are able to detect and prohibit invalid type conversions. Some common type operations are summarized in the following table:

|| *type operation* || *allowed conversion* || *note* || 
|| implicit conversion || up type hierarchy || static and safe  ||  
|| dynamic_cast || within type hierarchy || safe, but relies on RTTI ||
|| static_cast || within type hierarchy || unsafe on down and horizontal casts || 
|| C-style or reinterpret_cast || any to any || unsafe (1) ||
|| C-style or reinterpret_cast from opaque || opaque to any || unsafe and error prone (2) ||

 # C-style type cast and reinterpret_cast operations allow any types to be converted to any other types. These casts include conversions up, down, and horizontal within type hierarchies, as well as across hierarchies. For valid conversions with in type hierarchies, these casts generate correct results. However, these casts do not detect or prohibit invalid down and horizontal casts within hierarchies and wrong type casts that across hierarchies. 
 # C-style type cast and reinterpret_cast from opaque allow opaques (such as void pointers, char or uchar pointers, integers) to be converted to pointers of any types. These opaques were originally converted from other pointer types. These casts do not detect or prohibit invalid end-to-end (original types to new types) conversions. And worse, these conversions via opaques completely bypass the language type system and could generate incorrect results even in valid type cast cases, such as up casting a multi-inherited child class to its parent classes. These two kinds of type casts are not safe in general, unless the opaques are casted back to their exactly original converted-from types without moving up or down in their hierarchies.

== Type Safety in PocoCapsule == 

Type safety in *_dependency-injection_* scenarios is ensured by the following two rules in PocoCapsule:

  * IoC proxies only apply implicit type conversions (for non-opaques).
  * IoC proxies use C-style type casts only to convert bean reference opaques back to their exactly original casted-from types (which are types declared in application descriptions).

The above two rules ensure 100% type safety in _dependency injection_ usage scenarios, namely dependency references are injected as IoC invocation input parameters. Type conversion errors will be reported by C++ compilers on building proxies. 

Type safety in *_directory-lookup_* scenarios is ensured by either of the following two rules in casting a bean reference opaque retrieved from a PocoCapsule bean directory (application context):

  * An user should specifies the bean's type-id on retrieving its reference opaque from the directory. PocoCapsule compares this type-id with the bean's original casted-from type-id (which is the _class_ attribute declared in application description) and only returns the opaque when the comparison exactly matchs or returns NULL on failure. User should only cast the returned opaque to the specified type before carrying out further casts (such as dynamic_cast). For instance:
{{{
 Foo* ref = (Foo*)ctxt->getBean("my-foo-bean", "Foo");
 if( ref == NULL ) {
    // could be a type error ...
 } 
}}}

  * The user should retrieve the bean's type-id from the directory (use the getBeanPtrTypeId() method on the application context). This is the pointer type id of the original declared type. User should only cast the opaque to the exactly type before perform further casts.
{{{
 Foo* ref = (Foo*)ctxt->getBean("my-foo-bean");
 const char* ptr_type_id = ctxt->getBeanPtrTypeId("my-foo-bean");
 if( ref!= NULL && strcmp(ptr_type_id, "Foo*") ) {
    // type error ...
 } 
}}}

== Miscellaneous ==
  * Type safety is not binary compability.
  * PocoCapsule type system treats C++ typedef'ed types as distinct types.
  * Implicit type conversions in PocoCapsule are not performed by PocoCapsule type system dynamically, but utilize C++ type system in the generated proxies.
